            <h3>Student Management System</h3>
            <p> The Project STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is developed in Python,
                and is specialized for managing school students data in mobile and
                computers. The application helps to store the Student’s Name, Age,
                Class, Gender, Phone No. and Student ID as the Primary Key.<br>
                In this modern era of computer technology software
                plays an important part. It has been really a tedious
                task to automate everything manually, where the data
                is maintained as hardcopy or a softcopy. Even if we try
                to automate it through any of the application software
                available, we find it very difficult to manipulate the
                data. Here we have made a serious effort to automate
                the work through this software. The software has
                been developed in Python as the front end for the
                MySQL as the back end for the database. </p>

            <h3>World clock</h3>
            <p>This project is a program for world clock using python.
                Today one cannot afford to rely on the fallible human beings, everyone wants to stand against
                the merciless competition, so it’s not to wise say “to err is human”. It’s outdated to rationalize
                your mistake.
                A world clock is a clock which displays the time for various cities around the world. ... The
                clock face can incorporate multiple round analogue clocks with moving hands or multiple
                digital clocks with numeric readouts, with each clock being labelled with the name of a major
                city or time zone in the world</p>
